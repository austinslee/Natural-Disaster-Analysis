# Instructions
To run the front-end web application you would have run [npm install] command first, to install all the libraries that we have used in our application. 
After that run [npm start] to run the web application. 

To run the API/server. Load the .ipynb file in google collab and also upload our dataset in the runtime directory. 
First run the collab block having this code [!pip install colabcode]. Once you have executed this code it would ask you to restart runtime. So just click on that button. 
After that run all the code blocks in collab except the block with code [!pip install colabcode].
You would also have to update the api url in the front end code. Because api url is always changed whenever you excute it from beginning.

To run the machine learning script, install pyspark with [pip install pyspark] then run [python ml.py]. It will ask you to give inputs of the state name, disaster type and the forecasting years. The output should give you the accuracy and RMSE of the models and as well as .png images of the forecasting timeline.
